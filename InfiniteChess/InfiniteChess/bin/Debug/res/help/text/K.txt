The king can move one square in any direction.
If an enemy piece's movement contains the king, it is in check.
If a player's king is in check, the only valid moves are those which take the king out of check.
If no such moves exist, the player is in checkmate and has lost.
It can capture any piece that is in its movement, unless capturing a piece would put it into check.
